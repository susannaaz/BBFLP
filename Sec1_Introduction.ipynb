    "\n",
    "> [Section 2 - Sky maps](Sec2_Sky_maps.ipynb): How to generate simple sky maps, including CMB and/or foregrounds using [PySM](https://github.com/galsci/pysm). Ongoing: integrate with existing tools (e.g. [susannaaz/BBSims](https://github.com/susannaaz/BBSims) or [simonsobs/BBSims](https://github.com/simonsobs/BBSims)) based on [PySM](https://github.com/galsci/pysm) and [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB).\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Section 3 - Schedule](Sec3_Make_and_Analyze_schedule.ipynb): Guide to creating a schedule using toast, reading a schedule, and splitting it into singular observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [Section 4 - TOD simulation](Sec4_Simulate_TOD_breakdown.ipynb): Introduction to [toast3](https://github.com/hpc4cmb/toast/tree/toast3) and [sotodlib](https://github.com/simonsobs/sotodlib). Here we explain how to generate Time-Ordered-Data (TOD) simulations. It is explained how to create a focal plane, and from a given schedule create a telescope, include boresight pointing information, weights, add the sky signal from some input map (that can be generated as shown in [Section 2](Sec2_Sky_maps.ipynb), and noise.  This is saved as an AxisManager in hdf5 format, which is compatible with the latest [PWG SAT simulations](https://github.com/simonsobs/pwg-scripts/tree/master/pwg-tds/pipe-s0002/v6), and can be easily coverted into books, to resemble the format of actual observations. Section 3 and Section 4 reproduce what is created with toast as in [Simulation_tod_TOAST](Simulate_tod_TOAST.ipynb), but allows us to visualize the intermediate steps and modify them without running the full simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Section 5 - Pre-process the data and make maps](Sec5_Preprocess_TOD_Make_maps.ipynb): Demonstration of methods to pre-process the TOD using different operations and filters applied to the data, and create maps using filter-bin map-making as implemented in sotodlib. This emulates how the real data will be processed. A demonstration of methods to convert maps between CAR and HEALPix format is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Section 6 - Master pipeline](Sec6_Master_pipeline.ipynb): Integration of BBMaster ongoing!\n"
