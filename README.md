# BBFLP - the First Light Pipeline for BB (Tutorials)
----------------------------------------------------

Overview for generating and pre-processing Simons Observatory (SO) SAT BB data products and manipulating these products, using processes that have *already* been developed by numerous people within SO (it is to be though of as a collection of useful tools, currently intended for personal use). 

The Jupyter notebook tutorials are focused on using toast/sotodlib for simulating and pre-processing data, including filter-bin mapmaking. Currently implementing integration with BBMASTER.
